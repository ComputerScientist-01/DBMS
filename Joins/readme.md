# AIM:To study the various Join operations on the database.
SQL joins are used to query data from two or more tables, based on a relationship between
certain columns in these tables.

The **INNER JOIN** keyword return rows when there is at least one match in both tables.

The **LEFT JOIN** keyword returns all rows from the left table (table_name1), even if there are no
matches in the right table (table_name2).

The **RIGHT JOIN** keyword Return all rows from the right table (table_name2), even if there are
no matches in the left table (table_name1).

The **FULL JOIN** keyword return rows when there is a match in one of the tables.
